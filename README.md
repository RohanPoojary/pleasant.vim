# pleasant.vim
A Pleasant colorscheme for our beloved Vim / NeoVim.

![Pleasant](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13658649/91580296-80818b00-e96a-11ea-8975-838a2aca3114.jpg)

Pleasant tries to represent the pleasant color scheme of a nightly beach. The colors have been picked from basic color theory & tweaked using [Lab](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/CIELAB_color_space) to maintain proper luminosity & color difference. May not be as meticulously tweaked as [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized). You can refer [wiki](https://github.com/RohanPoojary/pleasant.vim/wiki) for more details on how.

This scheme is heavily inspired by my favourite [nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-vim). Hence it has a dark nordish touch to it.
The project layout is similar to famous [dracula](https://github.com/dracula/vim).


# Installation
Install using your favourite plugin manager.

```
Plug 'RohanPoojary/pleasant.vim'
